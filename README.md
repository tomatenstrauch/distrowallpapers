# distrowallpapers
A collection of wallpapers for different distributions

This collection is at this moment still a work-in-progress. 
------
In this github repo I upload some Blender renders of my own interpretations of logos and themes of popular OS, intended for use as a wallpaper. This project is not officially endorsed by any of the OS featured or the companies/associations behind them.
